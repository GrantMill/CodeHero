imagine you want to use, agentic orchestrations to write software. Capture, update and track specifications, create and maintain backlogs, start with simple architectures and create diagrams and BDD tests.

Then flesh out the code, pipelines, hosting and deployment.

Track revenue streams, costs of ownership, tech debt and support issues.

code changes should update documentation architecture and deployments. Diagram changes should make changes to code/ security pipelines.

I want data to fine tune the whole process to come from my code-base / docs / backlog
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 0s
Below is a concrete, Azure-first reference design for “agentic software delivery”—where agents read/write your repo, specs, diagrams, tests, pipelines, and telemetry; changes propagate bidirectionally (e.g., diagram ⇄ code), and the repo remains the source of truth. I’ve kept it practical with snippets and trade-offs.

1) Core idea
Repo-as-OS: Everything is files (specs, backlog, C4 diagrams, BDD, infra, policies). Agents only act via PRs.

Event-driven loop: Any change (spec/code/diagram/test/pipeline) emits events → orchestrator assigns agents → agents propose PRs → CI evaluates → humans approve.

Traceability graph: Requirements ↔ designs ↔ code ↔ tests ↔ infra ↔ cost/incident telemetry; IDs enforced in PR checks.

Data exhaust fuels improvement: agents log decisions + diffs + eval scores; nightly jobs distill this into a dataset for fine-tuning.

2) High-level platform

Suggested building blocks

Orchestration: Azure Durable Functions (Netherite) or Temporal (self-hosted) for human-in-the-loop, retries, and compensations.

LLM layer: Azure OpenAI + RAG (Azure AI Search) over your code/docs/backlog + vectorized PR history.

Policy & evals: OPA/Rego (security/GRC), Unit/BDD + mutation tests, LLM evaluation harness.

Diagrams: Structurizr DSL (C4) as the design source; agents keep src/ + iac/ consistent with DSL tags.

3) Repository contract (conventions)
/docs
  /specs/*.md             # “Spec-123.md” with YAML header including RequirementId
  /adrs/ADR-0001-*.md
  /backlog/product.md     # structured Backlog items in markdown tables
/arch
  c4.dsl                  # single source of design truth
  threatmodel.md

  tools/*.yaml            # tool schemas and invocation rules
Traceability ID format: REQ-123, DES-42, ADR-7, TM-5.
Embedded in:

Spec frontmatter: ids: [REQ-123]

C4 elements: tag "REQ-123"

Code comments: // REQ-123

Test names: Scenario: REQ-123 should ...

4) Orchestrator skeleton (C#, Durable)
[FunctionName("AgenticOrchestrator")]
public async Task Run(
    [OrchestrationTrigger] IDurableOrchestrationContext ctx)
{
    var evt = ctx.GetInput<RepoEvent>(); // push, PR, file change
    var plan = await ctx.CallActivityAsync<Plan>("PlanAgent", evt);

    foreach (var task in plan.Tasks)
    {
        var result = await ctx.CallSubOrchestratorAsync<AgentResult>(
            task.AgentName, task);
        await ctx.CallActivityAsync("PostPR", result.Change);
    }

    // Wait on CI checks and human review
    var approval = await ctx.WaitForExternalEvent<Approval>("PRApproved");
    if (!approval.Accepted) { /* compensate or re-plan */ }
}
Trade-offs

Durable/Temporal give retries, fan-out, compensation. Temporal is polyglot; Durable is native for C#.

Keep humans as ultimate approvers (policy). Agents propose, reviewers own merges.

5) Agent roles (minimal set)
Spec Agent: normalizes a user story into acceptance criteria, updates /docs/specs/Spec-123.md, cross-links REQ IDs.

Backlog Agent: triage + size + link to specs; keeps /docs/backlog/product.md prioritized.

Architecture Agent: edits arch/c4.dsl (+ threat model), emits ADRs for significant choices; opens PRs for src/ & iac/ deltas implied by the DSL.

Code Agent: scaffolds services, ports, DTOs from DSL & BDD; never bypasses tests; incremental PRs.

BDD/Test Agent: drafts Gherkin + skeleton steps; suggests property & mutation tests where needed.

Infra Agent: generates/updates Bicep/Terraform/Pulumi from DSL tags (envs, resources, ports).

Security/GRC Agent: updates OPA policies; enforces org controls; ensures threat model coverage per REQ.

FinOps/TechDebt Agent: tags resources for cost, computes COE, updates /docs/finops.md and /docs/techdebt.md.

Guardrails: Each agent has a .agent/roles/*.yaml with allowed paths, allowed tools, and PR size limits.

6) Diagram → code/infra round-trip
Structurizr DSL (source of truth):

workspace "Service X" "C4 Model" {
  model {
    softwareSystem "ServiceX" {
      container "API" "C# .NET 8" "REQ-123,DES-42"
      container "Worker" "Queue processor" "REQ-124,DES-43"
      container "DB" "Azure SQL" "DES-44"
      relationship "API" -> "DB" "EF Core" "DES-45"
      relationship "Worker" -> "DB" "Bulk writes" "DES-46"
    }
  }
  views { container ServiceX { include * } }
}
Mapping rules (Infra Agent):

container "API" → iac/api.bicep (App Service/AKS) + src/ServiceX.Api/.

relationship API->DB → connection string secret + firewall policy.

Tags like REQ-123 must appear in Controller summaries and SpecFlow scenarios; failing this blocks PR.

OPA/Rego gate (rejects drift):

package arch.sync

deny[msg] {
  some r
  required := input.arch.required_tags[r]
  not input.repo.code_tags[r]
  msg := sprintf("Missing tag %s in code for design %s", [r, input.arch.design_id])
}
7) BDD as the executable contract
Feature file (/tests/bdd/Feature-REQ-123.feature):

@REQ-123 @DES-42
Feature: Retrieve account balance

  Scenario: REQ-123 returns current balance for valid account
    Given an account "12345" with balance 250.00
    When I GET "/accounts/12345/balance"
    Then the response status is 200
    And the body contains "balance": 250.00
Step skeleton (SpecFlow/C#):

[Binding]
public class BalanceSteps
{
    private HttpResponseMessage _resp;

    [Given(@"an account ""(.*)"" with balance (.*)")]
    public async Task GivenAccount(string id, decimal amount) { /* seed fixture */ }

    [When(@"I GET ""(.*)""")]
    public async Task WhenIGet(string path) => _resp = await Client.GetAsync(path);

    [Then(@"the response status is (.*)")]
    public void ThenStatus(int status) => Assert.AreEqual(status, (int)_resp.StatusCode);

    [Then(@"the body contains ""balance"": (.*)")]
    public async Task ThenBody(decimal expected) { /* parse and assert */ }
}
8) CI policy (Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions) — links + evals
# /pipelines/ci.yaml
trigger: none
pr:
  branches: [ main ]
stages:
- stage: Validate
  jobs:
  - job: Traceability
    steps:
    - script: dotnet tool run tracecheck -- --require-tags REQ- --paths src,tests,arch,docs
    - script: dotnet test --filter TestCategory!=Slow
    - script: dotnet tool run mutationtest -- --threshold 65
    - script: opa eval -i build/arch_and_repo.json -d policies/opapolicy.rego "data.arch.sync.deny"
  - job: Security
    steps:
    - script: trivy fs .
    - script: dotnet list package --vulnerable
    - script: checkov -d iac/
  - job: Build
    steps:
    - script: dotnet build -c Release
    - script: docker build -f Dockerfile -t svc:${{ variables.GitSha }} .
  - job: Evals
    steps:
    - script: dotnet tool run llm-eval --specs docs/specs --changes $(System.PullRequest.SourceBranch)
Fail the PR if:

Any REQ-* present in specs/diagrams is missing in code/tests.

C4 relationship has no corresponding policy/secret/port in iac/.

Mutation coverage below threshold on changed files.

LLM eval regressions for changed endpoints (golden Q&A or BDD).

9) Change propagation examples
Diagram change → code/infra PRs

User edits arch/c4.dsl to add container "Reporting".

Orchestrator emits ArchChanged.

Architecture Agent generates ADR-007.

Infra Agent scaffolds iac/reporting.bicep + network rules.

Code Agent scaffolds /src/Reporting.*.

BDD Agent adds Feature-REQ-200.feature from spec deltas.

CI gates ensure tags, tests, security present.

Code change → docs/diagram PRs

Dev commits controller ReportsController referencing REQ-200.

Orchestrator detects new REQ-200 in code not in DSL.

Architecture Agent proposes DSL delta + ADR.

Backlog Agent updates docs/backlog/product.md (status).

10) FinOps, Tech Debt, Support
Cost mapping

Every resource tagged: service, env, reqIds (comma-sep), owner.

FinOps Agent queries Cost Mgmt API ⇒ aggregates to REQ-* and updates /docs/finops.md.

Tech debt ledger (/docs/techdebt.md table with severity/SLA):

Populated from static analysis (Sonar/SARIF), flaky tests, incident postmortems.

Each entry references REQ-*/DES-*, enabling business trade-offs.

Support issues

Incident templates require linking endpoint + REQ-*.

Agent posts RCA skeletons; CI ensures post-incident tasks in backlog.

11) Data pipeline for fine-tuning
Inputs: PR diffs, commit messages, specs, features, DSL changes, CI outcomes, eval scores, incidents.

ETL: nightly job builds “episodes”:

Context: relevant files + embeddings

Agent plan and action (tool calls, edits)

Outcome: CI/eval pass/fail, latency, review comments summary

Store: Parquet in a lake (Fabric/ADLS), plus vector store of chunks with labels.

Use: SFT or DPO to improve planning/coding policies; lightweight LoRA on small models for on-prem.

Privacy/Governance: redact secrets; only log diffs, not entire payloads; align with data handling policy.

12) Example “Plan Agent” pseudo-prompt (YAML)
role: system
name: PlanAgent
tools: [git.read, git.diff, repo.search, kql.query, policy.check, pr.create]
content: |
  You plan which agents to call to satisfy a change. Always:
  - Read repo events; map to REQ/DES ids.
  - Validate C4 DSL as design source.
  - Produce a minimal DAG of tasks (max 5 at once).
  - Never push directly; always propose PRs under 300 lines per PR.
  - Require BDD before Code; Code before Infra; Security checks before Merge.
13) Incremental rollout (keep it safe)
MVP (1–2 weeks)

Repo conventions + traceability IDs

Spec/Backlog/BDD agents only (read-write PRs), humans review

CI gates for IDs + tests

Phase 2

Architecture & Infra agents (read-only suggestions → PRs)

OPA policy checks; Structurizr DSL as source of truth

Phase 3

FinOps/TechDebt agents; cost tagging; incident linkage

LLM eval harness; golden tests; mutation testing gates

Phase 4

Data pipeline → fine-tuning; policy learning from your own repo

14) Risks & trade-offs
Drift: solved by single DSL source + OPA gates; cost is stricter PR friction.

LLM hallucinations: RAG + narrow tool permissions + small PRs + evals.

Throughput vs. review fatigue: batching + size limits + bot etiquette.

Vendor lock-in: Durable is Azure-native; Temporal gives portability but adds ops overhead.

Security: agents are least-privileged; tools are declarative; secrets never leave CI.

Non-technical summary
You’ll keep one source of truth—the repo—and let a set of specialized AI helpers propose small, reviewable PRs for specs, backlogs, diagrams, code, tests, infra, security, and cost docs. A central workflow coordinates them. Automated checks ensure every requirement is reflected in design, code, tests, and infrastructure, and any diagram change triggers matching code/pipeline updates (and vice versa). All activity and results are logged to build a dataset so the helpers steadily improve, trained only on your own codebase and documents.

wouldn't semantic kernel be better instead of or as well as durable functions? chron jobs might work for the fine tuning but it would be good if the agents all review each PR and vote for conflict resolution. votes are weighted according to their specialisation.

Human should only approve what is deemed to be important. (ie requirements to avoid drift, Security and architectural trade offs.)
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 20s
Short answer: use both.

Semantic Kernel (SK) is great for agent reasoning, tool-use, planning, and PR review “judgement calls.”

Durable Functions/Temporal are great for reliable, long-running orchestration (timeouts, retries, fan-out/fan-in, compensations, external events).

A clean split is: SK runs the brains; Durable runs the bones. Cron (or scheduled pipelines) can absolutely handle the periodic fine-tuning jobs.

Below is a concrete pattern for: SK-based agent reviewers, a weighted voting system, Durable orchestration for PR workflows, and a “humans only approve the important stuff” gate.

1) Control-plane vs. reasoning-plane
Reasoning-plane (SK):

Agent policies, tool schemas, skill routing, PR diff analysis, code/safety reasoning, and “review votes.”

SK’s Planners and Stepwise flows are good for breaking down “review PR” into sub-checks (spec, arch, security, test coverage, cost, perf).

Control-plane (Durable/Temporal):

Subscribe to repo webhooks (push/PR/open/synchronize).

Fan out review tasks to agent reviewers, collect votes with timeouts/retries, and decide next action (merge, require human, or request changes).

Persist state, ensure idempotency, and handle human external events (“Architect approved”, “Security vetoed”).

Why hybrid?

SK alone lacks durable timers, orchestration history, and exactly-once semantics.

Durable alone lacks rich LLM planning and tool reasoning.

Together: you get robust execution + smart judgement.

2) PR review & voting model (weighted, role-aware)
Agents (examples):

Spec Agent (traceability, BDD conformance)

Architecture Agent (C4/ADR alignment)

Security Agent (threat model, SAST/DAST findings)

Code Quality Agent (readability, patterns, mutation deltas)

FinOps Agent (cost impact, tagging)

Infra Agent (IaC diffs, policy drift)

Reliability Agent (SLOs, resiliency patterns)

Each agent produces a structured vote:

{
  "pr": 1234,
  "agent": "Security",
  "dimensions": {
    "spec_compliance": 0.0,
    "security_risk": -0.9,
    "arch_alignment": 0.1,
    "operability": 0.0,
    "cost_impact": -0.1
  },
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "rationale": "New endpoint lacks authz; missing threat tags REQ-218."
}
Aggregation (example):

Maintain role weights and agent trust (EMA over past accuracy).

Compute score per dimension:
score_d = Σ_i (weight_role(agent_i, d) * trust_i * dimension_i)

Apply hard vetoes: if security_risk < -0.7 from Security Agent with confidence > 0.8 → force “human review.”

Decision policy:

score_overall > +0.4 and no vetoes → auto-merge (for low-risk categories)

-0.1 ≤ score_overall ≤ +0.4 → request changes (agent auto-comments with actionable fixes)

score_overall < -0.1 or any veto → require human approval (security/arch)

Weighting seeds (tune from history):

weights:
  spec_compliance:
    Spec: 1.0
    CodeQuality: 0.3
    Architecture: 0.3
    Security: 0.1
  security_risk:
    Security: 1.0
    Architecture: 0.4
    Infra: 0.4
  arch_alignment:
    Architecture: 1.0
    Security: 0.2
    Infra: 0.5
  operability:
    Reliability: 1.0
    Infra: 0.4
  cost_impact:
    FinOps: 1.0
    Architecture: 0.2
Trust update (per PR outcome):

trust_i := 0.9 * trust_i + 0.1 * accuracy_i
accuracy_i = 1 if agent’s recommendation agreed with final (post-deploy) evals; else 0
3) Durable orchestrations (fan-out reviewers, timeouts)
Orchestrator skeleton (C# / Durable Functions)

[FunctionName("PrReviewOrchestrator")]
public async Task Run([OrchestrationTrigger] IDurableOrchestrationContext ctx)
{
    var pr = ctx.GetInput<PrEvent>();

    // 1) Fetch PR metadata/diff (activity)
    var diff = await ctx.CallActivityAsync<PrDiff>("GetPrDiff", pr);

    // 2) Fan-out requests to agent reviewers (sub-orchestrations or activities)
    var reviewers = new[] { "Spec", "Security", "Architecture", "CodeQuality", "Infra", "FinOps", "Reliability" };
    var tasks = reviewers.Select(r =>
        ctx.CallActivityAsync<AgentVote>("RunSkAgentReview", new AgentReviewRequest(r, diff, pr)));
    var timeout = ctx.CurrentUtcDateTime.AddMinutes(8);
    var voteTask = await Task.WhenAny(Task.WhenAll(tasks), ctx.CreateTimer(timeout, CancellationToken.None));

    var votes = new List<AgentVote>();
    if (voteTask == tasks) votes = tasks.Select(t => t.Result).ToList();  // all returned on time
    else
    {
        // collect completed tasks only
        votes = tasks.Where(t => t.IsCompletedSuccessfully).Select(t => t.Result).ToList();
        // optionally re-try laggards or proceed with quorum
    }

    // 3) Aggregate votes (activity)
    var decision = await ctx.CallActivityAsync<ReviewDecision>("AggregateVotes", votes);

    // 4) Post GitHub/AzDO Check with rationale (activity)
    await ctx.CallActivityAsync("PostCheck", (pr, decision, votes));

    // 5) Route per policy (auto-merge low-risk; request changes; or wait external approvals)
    if (decision.Action == ReviewAction.AutoMerge)
        await ctx.CallActivityAsync("AutoMerge", pr);
    else if (decision.Action == ReviewAction.RequireHuman)
    {
        var approval = await ctx.WaitForExternalEvent<HumanApproval>("ArchitectOrSecurityApproval");
        if (approval.Approved) await ctx.CallActivityAsync("AutoMerge", pr);
        else await ctx.CallActivityAsync("RequestChanges", (pr, decision));
    }
    else
    {
        await ctx.CallActivityAsync("RequestChanges", (pr, decision));
    }
}
Activity calling SK

[FunctionName("RunSkAgentReview")]
public async Task<AgentVote> RunSkAgentReview([ActivityTrigger] AgentReviewRequest req)
{
    var kernel = KernelFactory.Create(req.AgentName); // loads tools/policies for that agent
    var plan = await kernel.RunAsync<AgentVote>("review_pr", new {
        diff = req.Diff,
        repo_context = req.ContextEmbeddings,
        ci_findings = req.CiFindings
    });
    return plan;
}
4) “Humans only on important stuff” (policy-driven)
Policy gates (OPA/Rego or simple rules):

Always require human for:

Changes to arch/c4.dsl, docs/adrs, policies/, security.yaml, authz code, or resources labeled critical=true.

Any Security veto or Architecture misalignment above severity threshold.

Requirements/traceability drift: a REQ/ADR tag added/removed without linked updates in code/tests/IaC.

Everything else (typos, non-critical refactors, test-only changes, doc sync) can be auto-merged if agent vote passes thresholds.

Example GitHub required checks:

traceability/req-links (must pass)

security/veto (must be “no veto”)

arch/alignment (pass or human required)

agent-vote/score>=0.4 (pass)

ci/tests (pass), mutation>=65% (pass on changed files)

5) Cron/scheduled jobs for fine-tuning
Use Azure ML / AI Foundry or GitHub Actions scheduled to run daily:

Export “episodes” from the last 24h: PR diffs, agent votes, rationales, CI outcomes, post-merge prod evals.

Build a Parquet dataset with:

Context chunks (code/spec/diagram excerpts)

Tool calls (which static analyzers, which gates)

Agent outputs (votes, rationales)

Ground truth labels (merged? later reverted? prod alarms?)

Train lightweight LoRA adapters for the reviewer skills; update SK model routing.

Recompute agent trust from observed accuracy.

All data comes from your repo, docs, backlog, and telemetry; redact secrets, hash identifiers.

Example: GitHub Actions nightly

on:
  schedule: [{ cron: "0 1 * * *" }]
jobs:
  build-dataset:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: ./scripts/export_episodes.sh --since 24h --out data/episodes.parquet
      - run: ./scripts/train_lora.sh data/episodes.parquet --out models/reviewer-lora
      - run: ./scripts/publish_model.sh models/reviewer-lora
6) Repo wiring (what lives where)
/.agents/                 # SK skill packs and prompts per agent
  security/
    system.md
    tools.yaml            # e.g., trivy, checkov, SARIF parsers
  architecture/
  spec/
  finops/
  ...
/policies/                # OPA/Rego, YAML gates
/scripts/                 # export_episodes.sh, train_lora.sh, etc.
/pipelines/ci.yaml        # runs analyzers & posts SARIF
/.durable/                # infra/template for the orchestration app
Voting schema (simple, file-based, also posted as PR check run artifact)

{
  "pr": 1234,
  "version": 1,
  "votes": [ /* AgentVote[] */ ],
  "weights": { /* per dimension */ },
  "trust": { "Security": 0.88, "Architecture": 0.73, ... },
  "decision": { "action": "RequireHuman", "score": 0.18, "reasons": ["Security veto: missing authz"] }
}
7) Diagram ⇄ code mutations via agents
Architecture Agent reads arch/c4.dsl and generates a change plan (controllers, ports, secrets, network rules).

Code/Infra Agents perform the edits as separate small PRs.

Security Agent adjusts policies (e.g., OPA rules or Defender exemptions).

Durable flow ensures the dependency order (e.g., secrets → IaC → code).

If a developer edits code first adding REQ-219 tags, Durable triggers the Architecture Agent to update the DSL and raise an ADR; the same review/vote flow applies.

8) Example: Security Agent in SK (pseudo)
public class SecuritySkill
{
    [KernelFunction("review_pr")]
    public async Task<AgentVote> ReviewAsync(string diff, string repo_context, string ci_findings)
    {
        // 1) Parse sarif, look for authz/crypto changes
        var findings = Sarif.Parse(ci_findings).CriticalAuthz();
        var risk = Heuristics.EstimateRisk(diff, findings);
        var missingThreatTags = Traceability.MissingThreatTags(diff, repo_context);

        return new AgentVote
        {
            Agent = "Security",
            Dimensions = new() {
                ["security_risk"] = -risk.Score,
                ["arch_alignment"] = missingThreatTags.Any() ? -0.5 : 0.1
            },
            Confidence = risk.Confidence,
            Rationale = risk.Summary
        };
    }
}
9) What changes require human approval (recommended)
Requirements (new REQ-*, change to acceptance criteria)

Threat model & Security (authn/z, data classification, network exposure)

Architecture/ADRs (service boundaries, data stores, cross-cutting concerns)

Production SLO/SLA terms

P0 incident remediations that alter policy baselines

Everything else: agent-voted + CI-gated auto-merge is acceptable with rollback plans.

10) Trade-offs & pitfalls
Concurrency & flapping: if many agents propose edits at once, enforce PR size caps and serialized merges per area (code/iac/docs).

Gaming the vote: keep agents independent; feed them different tool views; persist raw rationales; audit decisions.

Model drift: nightly evals and rolling back LoRA weights if accuracy dips.

Human bandwidth: enforce tight scopes on “important” approvals and give reviewers compact rationales + diffs.

Security of tools: agents run with least privilege; SK tool layer whitelists commands; Durable activities sanitize inputs.

Non-technical summary
Use Semantic Kernel for the “thinking” (agents that review PRs and vote) and Durable Functions for the “doing” (reliably collecting votes, enforcing rules, handling approvals, and merging). Each PR is reviewed by multiple specialized AI agents whose votes are weighted by expertise and past accuracy. If security or architecture looks risky—or requirements changed—a human must approve. Routine changes can merge automatically if tests and checks pass. Nightly jobs use your own repo’s data to train the agents to get better over time.

If I wanted to build this - so that it builds itself bootstrap style how would you start simplest way possible
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 13s
Here’s the smallest-possible, bootstrap path: a repo that can start policing itself on Day 1 with just GitHub Actions + a tiny SK-based reviewer, then gradually “lets agents write more of the repo.” We’ll start with one rule, one agent, one vote, one gate—then let that agent propose the next pieces.

0) Create the repo with a tiny contract
Start with only the files below. This is enough to get a working PR check that blocks merges unless requirements are referenced in code/tests.

/docs/specs/Spec-000.md           # one tiny requirement (REQ-000)

1) The tiniest SK agent (one reviewer, one vote)
agents/spec-review/Program.cs

using System.Text.Json;
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Connectors.OpenAI;

record Vote(string Agent, double SpecCompliance, double Confidence, string Rationale);

class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        // inputs from CI
        var diffPath = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("PR_DIFF_PATH") ?? "diff.txt";
        var contextPath = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("REPO_CONTEXT_PATH") ?? "context.txt";
        var diff = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(diffPath);
        var ctx  = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(contextPath);

        // minimal SK kernel
        var builder = Kernel.CreateBuilder();
        builder.AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion(
            deploymentName: Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT")!,
            endpoint:       Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT")!,
            apiKey:         Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_KEY")!
        );
        var kernel = builder.Build();

        var prompt = """
You are SpecReviewer. Rate how well this PR's diff preserves requirement traceability.
Rules:
- If any REQ-xxx present in /docs/specs is removed or not referenced in src/ or tests, flag low compliance.
- If new code is added without any REQ-xxx comment, deduct.
- Ignore formatting-only changes.

Return JSON with fields: SpecCompliance[-1..+1], Confidence[0..1], Rationale (1-2 sentences).
DIFF:
```diff
{{diff}}
CONTEXT (list of requirement IDs you know from the repo):

{{ctx}}
""";

    var func = kernel.CreateFunctionFromPrompt(prompt);
    var result = await kernel.InvokeAsync(func, new() { ["diff"] = diff, ["ctx"] = ctx });

    // naive JSON extraction; if LLM returns invalid JSON, default to a conservative vote
    Vote vote;
    try { vote = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Vote>(result.ToString()!)!; }
    catch {
        vote = new Vote("Spec", SpecCompliance:-0.5, Confidence:0.5, Rationale:"Failed to parse vote; conservative no.");
    }

    var output = new {
        pr = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("PR_NUMBER") ?? "unknown",
        agent = "Spec",
        dimensions = new { spec_compliance = vote.SpecCompliance },
        confidence = vote.Confidence,
        rationale = vote.Rationale
    };

    var outPath = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("VOTE_OUT") ?? "vote.json";
    await File.WriteAllTextAsync(outPath, JsonSerializer.Serialize(output, new JsonSerializerOptions { WriteIndented = true }));
    Console.WriteLine($"Wrote vote → {outPath}");
}
}


**agents/spec-review/appsettings.json** (optional, or feed via env)
```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini"
}
This single agent produces a JSON vote: spec_compliance ∈ [-1..+1] + confidence.

2) The smallest aggregator (no Durable yet)
Let GitHub Actions do orchestration for now. We’ll aggregate one vote and set a commit status. (When you add more agents, just collect multiple vote.json files and compute a weighted sum.)

Inside the workflow we’ll run a tiny Node/PowerShell/Bash aggregator. Here’s a Bash-only version:

# scripts/aggregate_votes.sh
set -euo pipefail
jq -s 'def clamp(x): if . > x then x elif . < -x then -x else . end; 
       def score(v): (v.dimensions.spec_compliance // 0) * (v.confidence // 0.5);
       { decision: (if (map(score) | add) > 0.2 then "pass" else "fail" end),
         score: (map(score) | add),
         votes: . }' votes/*.json > decision.json

cat decision.json
if jq -e '.decision=="fail"' decision.json >/dev/null; then exit 3; fi
3) Minimal PR workflow (GitHub Actions)
.github/workflows/pr.yml

name: PR Checks
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      checks: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 1) Traceability gate (dumb but effective)
      - name: Traceability
        run: |
          chmod +x scripts/tracecheck.sh
          scripts/tracecheck.sh

      # 2) Produce PR diff + context
      - name: Collect diff and context
        run: |
          git fetch origin ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }} --depth=1
          git diff origin/${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}...HEAD > diff.txt
          grep -Rho "REQ-[0-9]\+" docs/specs | sort -u > context.txt
          mkdir -p votes

      # 3) Build and run SK Spec reviewer
      - name: Setup .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
        with: { dotnet-version: '8.0.x' }

      - name: Build reviewer
        working-directory: agents/spec-review
        run: dotnet build -c Release

      - name: Run reviewer
        env:
          AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT: ${{ secrets.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT }}
          AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT: ${{ secrets.AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT }}
          AZURE_OPENAI_KEY: ${{ secrets.AZURE_OPENAI_KEY }}
          PR_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.number }}
          PR_DIFF_PATH: diff.txt
          REPO_CONTEXT_PATH: context.txt
          VOTE_OUT: votes/spec.json
        run: dotnet run --project agents/spec-review/spec-review.csproj -c Release

        run: |
          chmod +x scripts/aggregate_votes.sh
          scripts/aggregate_votes.sh

      # 5) Post result as a check
      - name: Upload decision
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: decision
          path: |
            votes
            decision.json
Behavior today: If a PR removes REQ tags or adds code without any REQ reference, the check fails. If compliant, it passes. The SK reviewer adds a little intelligence (e.g., “format-only change” won’t tank you).

4) Let the system “build itself” (first bootstrap move)
With that base in place, open a PR titled “Add Architecture Agent skeleton.” Don’t write the agent—ask the Spec agent to propose it:

Create an issue: “Add Architecture Agent + OPA gate v0” with acceptance:

New folder /agents/arch-review/ with Program.cs similar to Spec agent

New /policies/arch.rego with one rule: any changes under /arch/ → require human approval

Modify workflow to run the new agent and aggregate two votes with weights {Spec: 0.6, Arch: 1.0} for arch_alignment

In the PR description, paste the acceptance criteria and say: “Reviewer agents: please propose exact file diffs.”
The Spec agent won’t edit files; but as you add the Code Agent later, that agent will propose concrete diffs.

On this first round, you create the arch agent by copy/paste from spec and tune the prompt—but treat it as if the agents asked for it. From now on, any new capability should be introduced via a PR, and the agents must pass their own gates.

5) Add the simplest “human-only” policy (no OPA yet)
In the workflow, add a guard that forces human review if certain paths changed:

      - name: Require human for sensitive paths
        if: contains(steps.changed_paths.outputs.paths, 'arch/') || contains(steps.changed_paths.outputs.paths, 'policies/') || contains(steps.changed_paths.outputs.paths, 'docs/specs/')
        run: |
          echo "This PR touches sensitive areas (arch/spec/policies). Human approval required."
          # We don't fail; we just rely on branch protection: require CODEOWNERS approval.
And add a minimal CODEOWNERS file:

/arch/*        @your-architects
/policies/*    @your-security
/docs/specs/*  @your-product
6) Capture data for fine-tuning (no ML yet)
Add a job that stores the “episode” (diff, votes, decision) as artifacts. That’s already done via upload-artifact. Later, you’ll add a nightly workflow that packs these into Parquet and trains LoRA adapters. For now: ✅ you have the data.

7) What the next 3 PRs should be (still small)
PR-2: Code Quality Agent (static heuristics)

Add /agents/codeq-review/ with a prompt that looks for readability regressions and missing tests on changed files.

Weight it lightly for now {CodeQ: 0.3}.

PR-3: “Generate missing BDD step skeletons”

Add a comment-only agent that proposes step method skeletons as PR review comments (does not edit files yet).

PR-4: IaC drift guard (very basic)

Add /policies/simple.yaml: if src/ introduces a new endpoint path, ensure a line appears in /docs/specs or tests/bdd mentioning it. (Implement with bash/grep—keep it dumb.)

Each PR is tiny; the system gains teeth without complexity.

8) When to add orchestration (Durable/Temporal)
Trigger: when you have ≥3 agents and want timeouts, quorum, retries, and human-event waits.

Add a small Azure Function with an HTTP trigger receiving GitHub webhooks.

For each PR, the orchestrator:

Schedules “review tasks” (call the same binaries the workflow uses).

Waits up to N minutes; aggregates early votes; posts a check-run summary.

If any vote is “security veto” (once you add that agent), set RequireHuman.

You can still keep GitHub Actions as the runtime for the agents (they’re just CLI apps). Durable handles coordination; Actions do the compute. That keeps ops overhead tiny.

9) How this bootstraps itself (practical loop)
You define a micro rule or capability (issue + acceptance).

Open a PR with empty folders or TODO stubs.

Existing agents review and comment on what’s missing (and eventually propose diffs once you give a Code Agent edit powers).

You merge if they pass minimal gates.

The new agent/policy is now part of the checks, increasing autonomy.

Episodes (diff+votes+decision) accumulate for later fine-tuning.

The system iteratively “learns” by codifying each review heuristic as another agent/policy, one PR at a time.

10) Guardrails to keep it safe while tiny
1–2 file changes per agent PR; <300 LOC diffs.

No secrets in prompts; use environment variables only in CI.

Branch protection: require “PR Checks” + 1 human review on sensitive paths.

If the reviewer JSON is malformed → conservative fail (done in code above).

Keep all agent binaries as CLI apps that can run locally and in CI (no server to operate).

Non-technical summary
Start with a very small repo that enforces one simple rule: every requirement mentioned in docs must show up in code and tests. Add a tiny AI “spec reviewer” to score each PR and a script that passes or fails based on the score. Use GitHub Actions only—no extra servers. Then iterate: add an architecture reviewer, a code quality reviewer, and simple path-based rules that always need a human. Each new capability is added via a PR so the system “teaches itself” how to review more things over time, and it saves all results so you can later train it on your own history. When this gets busy, add Durable Functions to coordinate multiple reviewers with timeouts and human overrides.

Ok I am using visual studio insiders 2026, and GitHub. From an Empty project how do I start building this application. 

Here is my road map

initial document describing how the application works.

we will have MD files that are requirements, Architecture diagrams and a plan of action in small steps. initially the application will just have a web interface that allows the user to either talk, type or add artifacts. These resources are saved in github to enable the application to build itself. 

requirements and architecture are in different directories and can be displayed by the application for edit and review.

At all times there should be a simple plan for the agent to proceed in small incrementable and testable steps.

once this base is in place we can add functionality incrementally as the application grows.

Create that first instruction for and plan for the copilot agent in Visual Studio to start construction.

Awesome—let’s bootstrap this so it can grow itself. Below is a minimal-but-complete starting point you can create in Visual Studio Insiders 2026 + GitHub. Then I’ve included a single Copilot instruction you can paste in VS to have it scaffold the first slice.

1) Repository scaffold (empty → working foundation)
Solution name: SelfBuild

Projects

SelfBuild.Web — ASP.NET Core minimal app with a tiny UI

SelfBuild.Agents.SpecReview — console app (Semantic Kernel later; stub today)

(Optional) SelfBuild.Tests — empty test project (we’ll add SpecFlow later)

Folders (repo-level)

/docs
  /requirements          # Markdown REQ files
  /architecture          # Diagrams (C4 DSL or Mermaid)
/plan
  Plan.md                # The living “small steps” checklist

# SelfBuild

A repo that builds itself, incrementally. Source of truth lives in the repo:
- `docs/requirements` – Markdown REQs (REQ-###)
- `docs/architecture` – Diagrams/DSL
- `plan/Plan.md` – Small, testable steps
- `artifacts/` – Uploaded sources for agents
- `SelfBuild.Web` – Thin UI to view/edit md and upload artifacts
- Agents (to be added) only propose PRs; humans approve “important” areas
plan/Plan.md

# Bootstrap Plan (M0 → M1)

## M0 (this PR)
- [ ] Web lists/reads/writes Markdown in `docs/requirements` and `docs/architecture`
- [ ] Upload artifacts to `/artifacts` with simple metadata
- [ ] Render Plan.md in a right-hand panel; allow check/uncheck and save
- [ ] Grep-based traceability gate in CI

## M1 (next)
- [ ] “New Requirement” flow creates `REQ-###.md` from a template
- [ ] Basic edit history (git commit message from UI)
- [ ] Add `SelfBuild.Agents.SpecReview` stub and GitHub Action aggregation

2) SelfBuild.Web minimal app (what Copilot will generate)
Goals

List, view, and edit Markdown files under /docs/requirements and /docs/architecture

Render plan/Plan.md and toggle checkboxes (persist back to file)

Upload artifacts to /artifacts (store filename + simple .yml next to it)

Keep all file I/O whitelisted to those folders (no arbitrary paths)

Recommended packages

Markdig for Markdown → HTML

YamlDotNet for small metadata files (optional at M0)

Config (appsettings.Development.json)

{
  "ContentRoots": {
    "Requirements": "docs/requirements",
    "Architecture": "docs/architecture",
    "Artifacts": "artifacts",
    "Plan": "plan/Plan.md"
  }
}
Endpoints/UI (M0)

GET /requirements → list REQ files

GET /requirements/{id} → render md → HTML

POST /requirements/{id} → save md back

GET /architecture → list diagram md/dsl files

GET /architecture/{name} → render md (plain for .dsl initially)

GET /plan → render Plan.md with checkboxes

POST /plan → persist toggled checklist

GET /artifacts → list; GET /artifacts/upload (form)

POST /artifacts → save file + .yml (timestamp, user, note)

Security note: M0 is for local dev. Add auth later.

3) Create the empty solution + projects
In Visual Studio Insiders 2026:

File → New → Project

ASP.NET Core Empty → SelfBuild.Web

Console App → SelfBuild.Agents.SpecReview (leave empty for now)

(Optional) xUnit Test Project → SelfBuild.Tests

Add the folder structure and files from section 1 at repo root.

Add NuGet to SelfBuild.Web:

Markdig
YamlDotNet
Set SelfBuild.Web as startup project.

4) The Copilot instruction (paste this in VS Chat)
Paste the block below verbatim into Copilot Chat inside the SelfBuild.Web project.

SYSTEM GOAL:
Implement M0 of SelfBuild.Web so the app can display and edit Markdown in repo folders and update Plan.md checkboxes. Keep the implementation small, safe, and incrementally testable.

CONTEXT (assumptions):
- Repo contains folders: docs/requirements, docs/architecture, artifacts, plan/Plan.md
- We are on .NET 8/9. No auth yet. Local dev only.
- We must not allow arbitrary path traversal; only whitelisted roots from configuration.

DEFINITION OF DONE (M0):
1) A FileStore service that exposes read/write list ops for whitelisted roots:
   - ListFiles(root)
   - ReadText(root, name)
   - WriteText(root, name, content)
   - SaveArtifact(file, note) → stores in /artifacts with YYYYMMDD-HHmm prefix and sidecar .yml
2) Minimal endpoints + Razor pages:
   - /requirements [list] → click-through to view/edit a single REQ markdown
   - /requirements/{name} [GET] → render md → HTML; [POST] → save updated md
   - /architecture [list] + view (render md; for .dsl show preformatted text)
   - /plan [GET] render Plan.md with checkboxes; [POST] saves toggled list back to Plan.md
   - /artifacts [GET] list; [GET] upload form; [POST] save upload + note
3) Add `appsettings.Development.json` with four roots:
   ContentRoots: Requirements, Architecture, Artifacts, Plan (path to plan/Plan.md)
4) Safety:
   - FileStore maps logical roots → absolute directories and rejects anything outside
   - Disallow filenames containing path separators; normalize and validate extension
5) UI:
   - Simple layout with left nav (Requirements, Architecture, Plan, Artifacts)
   - Textarea editor for md, submit button, success message
6) Traceability:
   - In Program.cs include a comment with REQ-000 so CI gate passes

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS (suggested order):
- Create `Services/FileStore.cs` with a Root enum and path map from config.
- Create `Extensions/Markdown.cs` using Markdig for rendering.
- Wire minimal endpoints in Program.cs for each route (can use Razor Pages for forms).
- Razor Pages: Requirements/List.cshtml, Requirements/Edit.cshtml, Architecture/List.cshtml, Architecture/View.cshtml, Plan/Index.cshtml (with checkbox parsing), Artifacts/Index.cshtml, Artifacts/Upload.cshtml
- Add small helpers to parse/serialize markdown task lists in Plan.md:
  - Recognize patterns `- [ ]` and `- [x]` and toggle based on posted form.
- Add basic validation (null/empty body, file not found).
- Add success/failure TempData banners.

ACCEPTANCE TEST HINTS (manual for now):
- Start app, visit /requirements → see REQ-000.md
- Click it → edit markdown, save → file changes on disk
- Visit /plan → toggle a checkbox → file Plan.md updated
- Upload small txt/pdf via /artifacts/upload → file appears in /artifacts with sidecar .yml

NON-GOALS (M0):
- AuthN/Z, PR automation, agents, SK integration, diagram → code sync

PLEASE GENERATE:
- New/updated files with full code for FileStore, endpoints, Razor pages, and helpers
- Minimal Program.cs wiring
- Example code comments indicating where REQ-000 is referenced
5) Commit & wire CI
Run the app locally; tick a Plan item; edit REQ-000.

Commit all changes and open a PR.

The pr.yml workflow will run tracecheck.sh and build—your first self-check.

6) Next tiny increments (after M0 merges)
M1a: “New Requirement” flow → creates REQ-###.md from a template with frontmatter (id/title/status).

M1b: Add simple Git integration from the UI (commit message textbox; call git via a safe wrapper so edits become commits).

M1c: Add SelfBuild.Agents.SpecReview stub + extend pr.yml to run it and produce decision.json (don’t block yet).

Trade-offs & tips

Keep file I/O whitelisted to prevent path traversal.

Avoid adding SK/Agents until the base UX is smooth.

Always add/modify a single capability per PR (≤ 300 LOC); the app should remain usable at every step.

Non-technical summary
We’ll start with a tiny web app that can list, view, and edit Markdown requirements and architecture docs, show a living plan you can tick off, and save artifacts. Everything writes straight into the repo so GitHub can track it. A simple CI script checks that requirement IDs appear in code/tests. You’ll paste one Copilot instruction that generates the first UI and file services. From there, we add features in small, safe steps—and later introduce agents that begin reviewing and proposing changes via PRs.

Create the empty solution + projects ==================================== In Visual Studio Insiders 2026: 1. **File → New → Project** * ASP.NET Core Empty → `SelfBuild.Web` * Console App → `SelfBuild.Agents.SpecReview` (leave empty for now) * (Optional) xUnit Test Project → `SelfBuild.Tests` 2. Add the folder structure and files from section 1 at repo root. 3. Add NuGet to `SelfBuild.Web`:

instuctions above are ok but 1 I want to list the human tasks separate from the agent tasks.

initially I guess I need to create a new solution and add the projects manually then create the structure inside the solution and add the starter files.

As part of that technology choices should be documented what I know I want to use so far is 

Blazor for the ui, MCP server for the agents, Microsoft Agent Framework, and dot net 9 to start with.

Given this additional context give me a step by step plan to get this up and running I want to demo it for an interview on Monday.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 38s
Perfect—let’s lock in a weekend-buildable plan that matches your stack (Blazor UI, MCP server for agents, Microsoft Agent Framework, .NET 9) and separates human vs agent tasks from the start. I’ll give you:

a step-by-step build plan you can follow in Visual Studio Insiders 2026,

the exact repo structure + starter files,

initial CI,

two “drop-in” Copilot instructions to generate code quickly,

a short demo script for Monday.

0) Technology choices (document first)
Create docs/architecture/TechChoices.md:

UI: Blazor Server (.NET 9) — fast CRUD over repo content, easy file I/O.

Agents: MCP server (console app over stdio, JSON-RPC) hosting “reviewers” and “planners”.

Agent runtime: Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) for orchestration within the server. (If MAF isn’t available on your machine yet, keep a thin IAgent abstraction so we can swap a SK adapter temporarily.)

Source of truth: Git repo folders (docs/requirements, docs/architecture, plan, artifacts).

CI: GitHub Actions with a tiny traceability gate.

.NET: 9.0.

This file is important—you’ll point interviewers at it to justify choices & trade-offs.

1) Human vs Agent tasks (two plans from day 1)
Create both files:

plan/Human.md – things you must do manually (auth decisions, ADRs, sensitive merges).

plan/Agent.md – small, testable increments agents can take (propose file diffs, suggest tests, nudge backlog).

plan/Human.md (seed)

# Human Plan (M0 → M1)
- [ ] Approve folder conventions and TechChoices.md
- [ ] Review & merge MCP server skeleton PR
- [ ] Approve any changes under /docs/requirements, /docs/architecture (sensitive)
plan/Agent.md (seed)

# Agent Plan (M0 → M1)
- [ ] Propose a new requirement template (REQ-001.md) from /SelfBuild.Web UI
- [ ] Suggest a checklist for “New Requirement” flow
- [ ] Detect missing REQ tags in changed Blazor components and raise a comment
Blazor will render/edit both files, side-by-side.

2) Create the solution & projects (VS Insiders 2026)
Solution: SelfBuild.sln

Projects

SelfBuild.Web — Blazor Server (.NET 9)

SelfBuild.Agents.McpServer — Console app hosting MCP server & agent pipeline

SelfBuild.Shared — Class library (DTOs: Requirement, PlanItem, Vote, etc.)

SelfBuild.Tests — xUnit (optional for the demo)

In Visual Studio:

File → New → Project

Blazor Server App → SelfBuild.Web (Framework: .NET 9)

Console App → SelfBuild.Agents.McpServer (.NET 9)

Class Library → SelfBuild.Shared (.NET 9)

(Optional) xUnit Test Project → SelfBuild.Tests

Add NuGet (SelfBuild.Web):

Markdig (Markdown rendering)

YamlDotNet (simple metadata sidecars)

Add NuGet (SelfBuild.Agents.McpServer):

Microsoft.Agent.Framework (if available on your feed/preview)
– If not yet, proceed without adding; we’ll code to an IAgent abstraction so we can plug MAF later.

System.Text.Json (built-in)

(Optional) Microsoft.SemanticKernel if you want a fallback adapter this weekend.

4) Blazor Web (M0): list/edit MD + toggle plans + artifact upload
4.1 Appsettings for whitelisted roots
SelfBuild.Web/appsettings.Development.json

{
  "ContentRoots": {
    "Requirements": "../docs/requirements",
    "Architecture": "../docs/architecture",
    "Artifacts": "../artifacts",
    "HumanPlan": "../plan/Human.md",
    "AgentPlan": "../plan/Agent.md"
  }
}
4.2 File store (safe whitelisting)
Create SelfBuild.Web/Services/FileStore.cs:

namespace SelfBuild.Web.Services;

public enum StoreRoot { Requirements, Architecture, Artifacts }

public sealed class FileStore(IConfiguration cfg, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    private readonly Dictionary<StoreRoot,string> _roots = new()
    {
        [StoreRoot.Requirements] = Resolve("ContentRoots:Requirements"),
        [StoreRoot.Architecture] = Resolve("ContentRoots:Architecture"),
        [StoreRoot.Artifacts]    = Resolve("ContentRoots:Artifacts")
    };

    private static string Normalize(string p) =>
        Path.GetFullPath(p).TrimEnd(Path.DirectorySeparatorChar, Path.AltDirectorySeparatorChar);

    private string Resolve(string key)
    {
        var path = cfg[key] ?? throw new InvalidOperationException($"Missing config: {key}");
        var root = Path.Combine(env.ContentRootPath, path);
        return Normalize(root);
    }

    private string Guard(StoreRoot root, string name, params string[] allowedExts)
    {
        if (name.IndexOfAny(Path.GetInvalidFileNameChars()) >= 0 || name.Contains(Path.DirectorySeparatorChar))
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Invalid filename.");
        var full = Normalize(Path.Combine(_roots[root], name));
        if (!full.StartsWith(_roots[root], StringComparison.Ordinal))
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Path traversal blocked.");
        if (allowedExts.Length > 0 && allowedExts.All(e => !name.EndsWith(e, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)))
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Extension not allowed.");
        return full;
    }

    public IEnumerable<string> List(StoreRoot root, params string[] exts) =>
        Directory.Exists(_roots[root])
            ? Directory.EnumerateFiles(_roots[root]).Where(f => exts.Length==0 || exts.Any(e => f.EndsWith(e, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)))
                       .Select(Path.GetFileName) : Enumerable.Empty<string>();

    public string ReadText(StoreRoot root, string name, params string[] exts) =>
        File.ReadAllText(Guard(root, name, exts));

    public void WriteText(StoreRoot root, string name, string content, params string[] exts) =>
        File.WriteAllText(Guard(root, name, exts), content);

    public (string SavedPath,string MetaPath) SaveArtifact(Stream file, string filename, string note)
    {
        var ts = DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("yyyyMMdd-HHmmss");
        var safe = Guard(StoreRoot.Artifacts, $"{ts}-{filename}");
        using var fs = File.Create(safe);
        file.CopyTo(fs);
        var meta = safe + ".yml";
        File.WriteAllText(meta, $"uploaded: {DateTime.UtcNow:o}\nname: {filename}\nnote: \"{note?.Replace("\"","''")}\"");
        return (safe, meta);
    }
}
4.3 Minimal Program.cs (Blazor)
SelfBuild.Web/Program.cs

using Markdig;
using SelfBuild.Web.Services;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
builder.Services.AddServerSideBlazor();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<FileStore>();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<MarkdownPipeline>(_ => new MarkdownPipelineBuilder().UseAdvancedExtensions().Build());

var app = builder.Build();
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment()) { app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error"); }
app.UseStaticFiles();
app.MapBlazorHub();
app.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
app.Run();

// REQ-000: UI supports listing and editing Markdown in requirements/architecture
4.4 Razor components (keep to 3 pages for M0)
Create in Pages/:

Requirements.razor – list and edit .md under docs/requirements

Architecture.razor – list & view .md under docs/architecture (render .dsl as <pre>)

Plan.razor – render Human.md and Agent.md with checkboxes; toggle and save

Skeleton for Requirements.razor (pattern repeats):

@page "/requirements"
@inject FileStore Store
@inject Markdig.MarkdownPipeline Md

<h3>Requirements</h3>

@if (selected is null)
{
    <ul>
        @foreach (var f in Store.List(StoreRoot.Requirements, ".md"))
        {
            <li><a @onclick="() => Load(f)">@f</a></li>
        }
    </ul>
}
else
{
    <h4>@selected</h4>
    <textarea class="w-100" style="height: 45vh" @bind="text"></textarea>
    <div class="mt-2">
        <button @onclick="Save">Save</button>
        <button class="ms-2" @onclick="() => { selected=null; text=null; }">Back</button>
    </div>
    <div class="mt-3">
        <h5>Preview</h5>
        @((MarkupString)Markdig.Markdown.ToHtml(text ?? string.Empty, Md))
    </div>
}

@code {
    string? selected;
    string? text;

    void Load(string f) { selected = f; text = Store.ReadText(StoreRoot.Requirements, f, ".md"); }
    void Save() { if(selected!=null && text!=null) Store.WriteText(StoreRoot.Requirements, selected, text, ".md"); }
}
Implement Architecture.razor similarly.

For Plan.razor, parse task list patterns - [ ] / - [x] for both Human.md and Agent.md, show two columns (Human vs Agent), and write back.

5) MCP server skeleton (console) + one tool
Goal: A runnable process at SelfBuild.Agents.McpServer that:

Speaks MCP JSON-RPC over stdio (enough to demo).

Exposes two tools:

list_requirements → returns REQ file names & IDs.

propose_next_agent_task → reads diffs & plan/Agent.md and outputs a small, testable step.

For interview demo, it’s fine if the “agent” is deterministic rule-based; wiring to MAF is a later PR.

Program.cs (minimal loop, fake MCP)

using System.Text.Json;
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;

record McpRequest(string Id, string Method, JsonElement Params);
record McpResponse(string Id, object? Result, object? Error);

static class Paths
{
    public static string Repo = Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(AppContext.BaseDirectory, "..", "..", "..", ".."));
    public static string ReqDir => Path.Combine(Repo, "docs", "requirements");
    public static string AgentPlan => Path.Combine(Repo, "plan", "Agent.md");
}

while (true)
{
    var line = Console.ReadLine();
    if (line is null) break;
    var req = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<McpRequest>(line)!;

    try
    {
        object? result = req.Method switch
        {
            "list_requirements" => Directory.EnumerateFiles(Paths.ReqDir, "*.md")
                .Select(f => new { file = Path.GetFileName(f), text = File.ReadAllText(f) }).ToArray(),

            "propose_next_agent_task" => ProposeTask(),

            _ => throw new InvalidOperationException("Unknown method")
        };
        Console.WriteLine(JsonSerializer.Serialize(new McpResponse(req.Id, result, null)));
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(JsonSerializer.Serialize(new McpResponse(req.Id, null, new { message = ex.Message })));
    }
}

static object ProposeTask()
{
    var plan = File.ReadAllText(Paths.AgentPlan);
    // Trivial heuristic: if no REQ-001 exists, propose it
    var has001 = Directory.EnumerateFiles(Paths.ReqDir, "REQ-001*.md").Any();
    if (!has001)
    {
        return new {
            title = "Create REQ-001.md from template",
            apply = new {
                path = "docs/requirements/REQ-001.md",
                content = """
---
id: REQ-001
title: New Requirement Template
status: draft
---
Template with acceptance criteria scaffold.

- [ ] Define acceptance criteria
- [ ] Link to architecture impact
- [ ] Create BDD feature
""" }
        };
    }
    return new { title = "No-op", message = "Nothing urgent identified." };
}
(We’ll wire Blazor to launch this process and show the proposed task; you can “apply” it by writing the file.)

6) Wire Blazor ↔ MCP server (button in Plan page)
Add a small service McpClient in Web that starts the console server process (SelfBuild.Agents.McpServer.exe), writes one JSON line (the request), reads the single response line, shows result in UI, and, if it contains an apply suggestion, allows the user to click “Apply” (write file). That gives you an end-to-end “agent proposes → human applies” demo.

7) GitHub Actions (as-is) + CODEOWNERS for sensitive paths
Add CODEOWNERS at repo root:

/docs/requirements/*  @your-handle
/docs/architecture/*  @your-handle
Configure branch protection to require one review when these paths change. That supports your “humans approve important stuff” principle from day 1.

8) Two Copilot instructions you can paste
8.1 For SelfBuild.Web (generate pages + FileStore)
Paste in Copilot Chat (project context: SelfBuild.Web):

Implement M0 of SelfBuild.Web (Blazor Server, .NET 9).

Requirements:
- Add Services/FileStore.cs that safely lists/reads/writes under whitelisted roots from appsettings.Development.json (keys: ContentRoots:Requirements, Architecture, Artifacts, HumanPlan, AgentPlan). Block path traversal and invalid chars.
- Pages: Requirements.razor, Architecture.razor, Plan.razor with simple list/edit UI. Plan.razor should render two columns: Human.md and Agent.md; show checkboxes for "- [ ]"/"- [x]" tasks and persist toggles back to file.
- Add a small McpClient service that runs ../SelfBuild.Agents.McpServer via ProcessStart, sends one JSON line request, reads one JSON line response, and returns it to the page. On Plan page, add a button "Ask Agent for Next Step" calling method "propose_next_agent_task". If response has an "apply" { path, content }, show an "Apply" button that writes the file using FileStore.
- Add Markdig pipeline as a singleton and render markdown previews.
- In Program.cs wire DI and include a code comment referencing REQ-000.

Produce complete code for the pages, FileStore, McpClient, and Program.cs updates.
8.2 For SelfBuild.Agents.McpServer (generate main loop)
Paste in Copilot Chat (project context: SelfBuild.Agents.McpServer):

Create a minimal MCP-like JSON-RPC server over stdin/stdout.

- Read one JSON object per line: { "id": "<id>", "method": "<name>", "params": {...} }
- Supported methods:
  - "list_requirements": returns array of { file, text } from ../../docs/requirements
  - "propose_next_agent_task": return an object with a small, testable suggestion. If REQ-001.md is missing, return:
    { title: "Create REQ-001.md from template", apply: { path: "docs/requirements/REQ-001.md", content: "<frontmatter+template>" } }
- Respond with a single line per request: { "id": "<id>", "result": <any>, "error": null } or { "error": { message } }
- Keep it synchronous & single-threaded for the demo.
- Target .NET 9, no external packages required.
Provide full Program.cs.
9) What to demo on Monday (script)
Open Blazor app → Requirements: show REQ-000.md, edit, save.

Architecture: open TechChoices.md.

Plan: show Human vs Agent columns; tick a checkbox and save.

Click “Ask Agent for Next Step” → the MCP server proposes creating REQ-001.md.

Click Apply → file appears in docs/requirements.

git add/commit/push → open PR → CI runs tracecheck.sh and fails until you add REQ-000 reference in Program.cs (already present) and maybe add a REQ-001 reference somewhere (good talking point).

Show CODEOWNERS forcing human review for requirements/architecture.

Wrap with TechChoices.md rationale.

10) Roadmap after demo (safe, incremental)
M1: New Requirement wizard in UI (auto-IDs), light Git commit from UI.

M1: Replace fake MCP loop with MAF orchestration inside SelfBuild.Agents.McpServer (same method signatures).

M2: Add “Spec reviewer” agent tool → emits a vote.json artifact; aggregate in CI (no auto-merge yet).

M2: Add speech input (Azure Speech SDK) to the Blazor page.

M3: Introduce OPA/Rego check that “requirements touched → human approval required”.

Non-technical summary
You’ll build a small Blazor app that edits Markdown requirements and architecture docs and keeps two simple checklists—one for humans, one for agents. A lightweight MCP server suggests the next tiny step (e.g., “create REQ-001.md”), and the UI can apply it into the repo. GitHub Actions runs a basic traceability check, while CODEOWNERS forces human approval for important folders. This gives you an end-to-end “self-building” demo by Monday, with clear upgrade paths to Microsoft Agent Framework and richer agent reviews later.

I need to start with a new solution to fix the root directory first the project name is AgentZero, give the projects to add directly and then lets put every other task in after that step
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 11s
Great—let’s lock the solution + projects first, then everything else comes after.

Create the solution and add projects (only this step now)
Option A — Visual Studio Insiders 2026 (GUI)
File → New → Project → Blank Solution

Name: AgentZero

Location: your desired root (this becomes the repo root)

Add Project → Blazor Server App (.NET 9)

Project name: AgentZero.Web

Add Project → Console App (.NET 9)

Project name: AgentZero.Agents.McpServer

Add Project → Class Library (.NET 9)

Project name: AgentZero.Shared

(Optional) Add Project → xUnit Test Project (.NET 9)

Project name: AgentZero.Tests

Add project references

AgentZero.Web → add reference to AgentZero.Shared

AgentZero.Agents.McpServer → add reference to AgentZero.Shared

AgentZero.Tests (if added) → references to AgentZero.Web and AgentZero.Shared

Set startup project: AgentZero.Web (Blazor Server)

Option B — dotnet CLI (copy/paste)
From the directory where you want the solution:

dotnet new sln -n AgentZero

dotnet new blazorserver -f net9.0 -n AgentZero.Web
dotnet new console       -f net9.0 -n AgentZero.Agents.McpServer
dotnet new classlib      -f net9.0 -n AgentZero.Shared
dotnet new xunit         -f net9.0 -n AgentZero.Tests   # optional

dotnet sln AgentZero.sln add AgentZero.Web/AgentZero.Web.csproj
dotnet sln AgentZero.sln add AgentZero.Agents.McpServer/AgentZero.Agents.McpServer.csproj
dotnet sln AgentZero.sln add AgentZero.Shared/AgentZero.Shared.csproj
dotnet sln AgentZero.sln add AgentZero.Tests/AgentZero.Tests.csproj  # optional

dotnet add AgentZero.Web/AgentZero.Web.csproj reference AgentZero.Shared/AgentZero.Shared.csproj
dotnet add AgentZero.Agents.McpServer/AgentZero.Agents.McpServer.csproj reference AgentZero.Shared/AgentZero.Shared.csproj
dotnet add AgentZero.Tests/AgentZero.Tests.csproj reference AgentZero.Web/AgentZero.Web.csproj
dotnet add AgentZero.Tests/AgentZero.Tests.csproj reference AgentZero.Shared/AgentZero.Shared.csproj
That’s it for this step.
Tell me when this compiles locally, and I’ll give you the next tasks (folders, starter files, CI, Blazor pages, and the MCP server stub) in a tight sequence, split into Human vs Agent work streams.

Non-technical summary
First, create a new solution named AgentZero with four projects: a Blazor Server app (AgentZero.Web), a console app for the MCP agent server (AgentZero.Agents.McpServer), a shared library for DTOs/utilities (AgentZero.Shared), and optional tests (AgentZero.Tests). Wire references so Web and MCP depend on Shared. Once this builds, we’ll add everything else step-by-step.

You said:
I think an aspire starter app is better - do I need anything for azure foundry integration. rework with these additional requirements
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 37s
Great call—use .NET Aspire Starter so we get the AppHost, health/telemetry defaults, and a clean way to compose services. Below is the reworked “projects first” step with Aspire + placeholders for Azure AI Foundry (Azure OpenAI) integration. I’m keeping it to just what you asked: create the solution and projects, wire references, and make it compile. We’ll add features in the next step.

Step 1 — Create the Aspire solution + projects
CLI (fastest)
# 1) Create Aspire starter solution
dotnet new aspire-starter -n AgentZero
cd AgentZero

# Projects created by the template:
# - AgentZero.AppHost
# - AgentZero.ServiceDefaults
# - AgentZero.sln

# 2) Add your projects
dotnet new blazorserver -f net9.0 -n AgentZero.Web
dotnet new console       -f net9.0 -n AgentZero.Agents.McpServer
dotnet new classlib      -f net9.0 -n AgentZero.Shared
dotnet new xunit         -f net9.0 -n AgentZero.Tests   # optional

# 3) Add projects to the solution
dotnet sln AgentZero.sln add AgentZero.Web/AgentZero.Web.csproj
dotnet sln AgentZero.sln add AgentZero.Agents.McpServer/AgentZero.Agents.McpServer.csproj
dotnet sln AgentZero.sln add AgentZero.Shared/AgentZero.Shared.csproj
dotnet sln AgentZero.sln add AgentZero.Tests/AgentZero.Tests.csproj  # optional

# 4) Wire references
dotnet add AgentZero.Web/AgentZero.Web.csproj reference AgentZero.Shared/AgentZero.Shared.csproj
dotnet add AgentZero.Agents.McpServer/AgentZero.Agents.McpServer.csproj reference AgentZero.Shared/AgentZero.Shared.csproj
dotnet add AgentZero.Tests/AgentZero.Tests.csproj reference AgentZero.Web/AgentZero.Web.csproj
dotnet add AgentZero.Tests/AgentZero.Tests.csproj reference AgentZero.Shared/AgentZero.Shared.csproj
Visual Studio Insiders 2026 (GUI)
File → New → Project → “.NET Aspire Starter App”
Name: AgentZero → creates AgentZero.AppHost + AgentZero.ServiceDefaults.

Add → New Project → Blazor Server (.NET 9) → AgentZero.Web.

Add → New Project → Console (.NET 9) → AgentZero.Agents.McpServer.

Add → New Project → Class Library (.NET 9) → AgentZero.Shared.

(Optional) Add xUnit → AgentZero.Tests.

References:

AgentZero.Web → AgentZero.Shared

AgentZero.Agents.McpServer → AgentZero.Shared

AgentZero.Tests → AgentZero.Web, AgentZero.Shared

Set startup: AgentZero.AppHost (Aspire orchestrates your services).

Step 2 — Register projects in the Aspire AppHost
Edit AgentZero.AppHost/Program.cs so the AppHost knows about your services. Keep it minimal; this composes the Blazor app and (optionally) the MCP server.

var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Compose the Blazor UI
var web = builder.AddProject<Projects.AgentZero_Web>("agentzero-web")
                 .WithReference(builder.AddProject<Projects.AgentZero_ServiceDefaults>("servicedefaults"));

// (Optional) compose the MCP server as a background project (no HTTP endpoint)
var mcp = builder.AddProject<Projects.AgentZero_Agents_McpServer>("agentzero-mcp");

// If you want to pass shared config (e.g., Azure AI Foundry endpoint/key), do it here:
web.WithEnvironment("AzureAI__Endpoint", "");   // fill later via user-secrets
web.WithEnvironment("AzureAI__Deployment", "");
web.WithEnvironment("AzureAI__Key", "");

// Dashboard/diagnostics come from ServiceDefaults by default
builder.Build().Run();
Aspire’s ServiceDefaults handles OpenTelemetry, health checks, and reasonable defaults. We’ll extend it later to register clients.

Step 3 — Add Azure AI Foundry (Azure OpenAI) client placeholders
Install packages now so compile + DI is ready for later:

dotnet add AgentZero.Web/AgentZero.Web.csproj package Azure.AI.OpenAI
dotnet add AgentZero.Web/AgentZero.Web.csproj package Azure.Identity
dotnet add AgentZero.Agents.McpServer/AgentZero.Agents.McpServer.csproj package Azure.AI.OpenAI
dotnet add AgentZero.Agents.McpServer/AgentZero.Agents.McpServer.csproj package Azure.Identity
Create a tiny client registration extension in AgentZero.ServiceDefaults so all services can opt-in:

// AgentZero.ServiceDefaults/AzureAiRegistration.cs
using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
using Azure;
using Azure.Identity;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

namespace AgentZero.ServiceDefaults;

public static class AzureAiRegistration
{
    public static IServiceCollection AddAzureAiFoundry(this IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config)
    {
        var endpoint = config["AzureAI:Endpoint"];
        var key = config["AzureAI:Key"];
        if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(endpoint))
        {
            if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(key))
                services.AddSingleton(new OpenAIClient(new Uri(endpoint!), new AzureKeyCredential(key)));
            else
                services.AddSingleton(new OpenAIClient(new Uri(endpoint!), new DefaultAzureCredential()));
        }
        return services;
    }
}
Then call it from Web and MCP Program.cs:

// AgentZero.Web/Program.cs (snippet)
builder.Services.AddAzureAiFoundry(builder.Configuration);
// AgentZero.Agents.McpServer/Program.cs (snippet)
var builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddAzureAiFoundry(builder.Configuration);
// add your hosted service later
await builder.Build().RunAsync();
For dev, set secrets:
dotnet user-secrets set "AzureAI:Endpoint" "https://<your-res>.openai.azure.com"
dotnet user-secrets set "AzureAI:Deployment" "<model-deployment-name>"
dotnet user-secrets set "AzureAI:Key" "<key-or-empty-for-ManagedIdentity>"

Aspire AppHost will forward env vars too; we’ll wire that in a later step.

Step 4 — Build & run the empty composition
dotnet build AgentZero.sln
dotnet run --project AgentZero.AppHost
You should see the Aspire dashboard and the agentzero-web service running. The MCP server project is registered but idle (we’ll add its hosted service + MCP loop later).

Step 5 — What’s next (queued for the next step, not to do now)
I’m listing these so they’re ready, but we won’t execute them until you confirm the solution compiles.

Human tasks (next):

Add repo folders (/docs/requirements, /docs/architecture, /plan, /artifacts) and seed files.

Create TechChoices.md and CODEOWNERS.

Add GitHub Action with traceability gate.

Blazor pages to list/edit Markdown + Human/Agent plan.

Agent tasks (next):

MCP server stub with two tools: list_requirements, propose_next_agent_task.

Simple Blazor button to call MCP (stdio JSON) and apply suggested file.

Register Microsoft Agent Framework in MCP project when ready.

Non-technical summary
We switched to a .NET Aspire Starter layout: AppHost orchestrates services, ServiceDefaults gives health/telemetry, and we added three projects—Web (Blazor), Agents.McpServer (console), and Shared—plus optional tests. We also prewired placeholders for Azure AI Foundry (Azure OpenAI) clients so you can plug credentials later. Build it now; once it runs, we’ll add folders, markdown UI, CI, and the first MCP tool in the next step.
