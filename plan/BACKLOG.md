Notes
- Priorities: unblockers first (Phase0), then infra (Phase1), indexer & CI (Phase2), retrieval API & observability (Phase3), orchestrator integration (Phase4), then code tooling and hardening.
- I removed duplicate/overlapping backlog entries and consolidated REQ-002/REQ-003 workstreams into the phased plan above.
