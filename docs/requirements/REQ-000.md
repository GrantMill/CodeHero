As a contributor, I can see a clear vision and two tracked plans (human vs agent) so we can deliver in small, testable steps.

Acceptance
- [x ] A concise vision statement exists in docs/VISION.md
- [x ] A Single backlog will exist to keep the construction on track 
- [x ] The backlog identifies Human and agent tasks
- [x ] CI builds the solution and runs tests on PRs
