title: Bootstrap baseline
status: draft

As a contributor, I can see a clear vision and two tracked plans (human vs agent) so we can deliver in small, testable steps.

Acceptance
- [ ] A concise vision statement exists in docs/VISION.md
- [ ] Separate plans exist in plan/HUMAN.md and plan/AGENT.md
- [ ] CI builds the solution and runs tests on PRs
